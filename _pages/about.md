I am a condensed matter theorist. My primary research interests lay in strongly correlated quantum systems, where strong inter-particle interactions together with the laws of quantum mechanics give rise to novel phases of matter. Notable examples are supercoductors, which conduct electrical current without dissipation and spin-liquids that defy freezing even at absolute zero temperature, among others.

The exponential scaling of quantum many-body problems poses a challenging computational task and making progress must rely on a profound understanding of the physical problem. Obstructions to simulating quantum systems using a classical computer with finite resources draw the line between the quantum and classical world. I am very actively involved
in devising new numerical methodologies such quantum Monte Carlo and tensor network based techniques that pushes this boundary and applying them in
various strongly correlated quantum systems, a research direction that has been proven to
be particularly fruitfully in the discovery of novel quantum phenomena.

**We are hiring!** Positions for excellent candidates are available at all level (postdoc, graduate and undergraduate students). In case that you are interested feel free to contact me via email. Please provide a short CV.
