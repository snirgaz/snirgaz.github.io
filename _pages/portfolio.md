## Topological phases in periodically driven systems

In recent years, the classication of topological phases of matter has been extended to periodically driven (Floquet) systems
far from equilibrium. Some of the predicted phenomena go beyond what is realizable by
static Hamiltonians, including chiral edge states belonging to quasi-energy bulk bands with
a vanishing Chern number and topologically protected transport of quantum information.
In a recent study, we examined a generalization of the Thouless charge pump, a simple
yet fundamental example of topology in quantum systems, to periodically driven systems.
We have demonstrated that in the out of equilibrium setting, energy, rather than charge, may
undergo quantized pumping. In particular, the energy transported per cycle is quantized in
units of the drive frequency leading to the absorption of precisely a single photon.
In a different study, we have considered the
