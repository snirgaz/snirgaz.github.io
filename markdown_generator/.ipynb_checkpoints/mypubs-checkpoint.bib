	abstract = {Magnetically frustrated Kondo lattices are correlated metals not governed by symmetry-breaking quantum criticality, offering a new perspective on the puzzling phenomenology of strange metal behavior and unconventional superconductivity. While this concept is likely to be realized in certain heavy-fermion compounds, the corresponding models are notoriously difficult to solve, hindering robust theoretical predictions. Here we provide a comprehensive solution for a 1D Kondo ladder with a frustrated valence bond solid ground state in the presence of a magnetic field. We prove the stability of the field-induced magnon Bose{\textendash}Einstein condensation and demonstrate the emergence of unconventional superconductivity. We also present strong evidence that our results carry over to two and three dimensions. These findings anchor future studies of frustrated heavy fermion systems.Motivated by recent experiments on magnetically frustrated heavy fermion metals, we theoretically study the phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model with a nonmagnetic valence bond solid ground state on a ladder. A similar physical setting may be naturally occurring in YbAl3C3, CeAgBi2, and TmB4 compounds. In the insulating limit, the application of a magnetic field drives a quantum phase transition to an easy-plane antiferromagnet, which is described by a Bose{\textendash}Einstein condensation of magnons. Using a combination of field theoretical techniques and density matrix renormalization group calculations we demonstrate that in one dimension this transition is stable in the presence of a metallic Fermi sea, and its universality class in the local magnetic response is unaffected by the itinerant gapless fermions. Moreover, we find that fluctuations about the valence bond solid ground state can mediate an attractive interaction that drives unconventional superconducting correlations. We discuss the extensions of our findings to higher dimensions and argue that depending on the filling of conduction electrons, the magnon Bose{\textendash}Einstein condensation transition can remain stable in a metal also in dimensions two and three.All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are available in the manuscript and SI Appendix.},

@article{Gazit2018,
	abstract = {Universal properties of quantum (zero-temperature) phase transitions are typically well-described by the classical Landau theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. A paradigmatic counterexample is deconfined criticality, where quantum interference allows for a direct and continuous transition between states with distinct symmetry-breaking patterns, a phenomenon that is classically forbidden. In this work, we extend the scope of deconfined criticality to a case where breaking of a global symmetry coincides with confinement of a local (gauge) symmetry. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate a lattice realization of this transition. Remarkably, we uncover emergent and enlarged global and gauge symmetries. These findings direct us in constructing a critical field theory description.We study a model of fermions on the square lattice at half-filling coupled to an Ising gauge theory that was recently shown in Monte Carlo simulations to exhibit Z2 topological order and massless Dirac fermion excitations. On tuning parameters, a confining phase with broken symmetry (an antiferromagnet in one choice of Hamiltonian) was also established, and the transition between these phases was found to be continuous, with coincident onset of symmetry breaking and confinement. While the confinement transition in pure gauge theories is well-understood in terms of condensing magnetic flux excitations, the same transition in the presence of gapless fermions is a challenging problem owing to the statistical interactions between fermions and the condensing flux excitations. The conventional scenario then proceeds via a two-step transition, involving a symmetry-breaking transition leading to gapped fermions followed by confinement. In contrast, here, using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide further evidence for a direct, continuous transition and also find numerical evidence for an enlarged SO(5) symmetry rotating between antiferromagnetism and valence bond solid orders proximate to criticality. Guided by our numerical finding, we develop a field theory description of the direct transition involving an emergent nonabelian [SU(2)] gauge theory and a matrix Higgs field. We contrast our results with the conventional GrossNeveuYukawa transition.},

	abstract = {We show that, in contrast to popular belief, sub-wavelength information can be recovered from the far-field of an optical image, thereby overcoming the loss of information embedded in decaying evanescent waves. The only requirement is that the image is known to be sparse, a specific but very general and wide-spread property of signals which occur almost everywhere in nature. The reconstruction method relies on newly-developed compressed sensing techniques, which we adapt to optical super-resolution and sub-wavelength imaging. Our approach exhibits robustness to noise and imperfections. We provide an experimental proof-of-principle by demonstrating image recovery at a spatial resolution 5-times higher than the finest resolution defined by a spatial filter. The technique is general, and can be extended beyond optical microscopy, for example, to atomic force microscopes, scanning-tunneling microscopes, and other imaging systems.},
