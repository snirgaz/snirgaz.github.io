abstract = {Universal properties of quantum (zero-temperature) phase transitions are typically well-described by the classical Landau theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. A paradigmatic counterexample is deconfined criticality, where quantum interference allows for a direct and continuous transition between states with distinct symmetry-breaking patterns, a phenomenon that is classically forbidden. In this work, we extend the scope of deconfined criticality to a case where breaking of a global symmetry coincides with confinement of a local (gauge) symmetry. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate a lattice realization of this transition. Remarkably, we uncover emergent and enlarged global and gauge symmetries. These findings direct us in constructing a critical field theory description.We study a model of fermions on the square lattice at half-filling coupled to an Ising gauge theory that was recently shown in Monte Carlo simulations to exhibit Z2 topological order and massless Dirac fermion excitations. On tuning parameters, a confining phase with broken symmetry (an antiferromagnet in one choice of Hamiltonian) was also established, and the transition between these phases was found to be continuous, with coincident onset of symmetry breaking and confinement. While the confinement transition in pure gauge theories is well-understood in terms of condensing magnetic flux excitations, the same transition in the presence of gapless fermions is a challenging problem owing to the statistical interactions between fermions and the condensing flux excitations. The conventional scenario then proceeds via a two-step transition, involving a symmetry-breaking transition leading to gapped fermions followed by confinement. In contrast, here, using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide further evidence for a direct, continuous transition and also find numerical evidence for an enlarged SO(5) symmetry rotating between antiferromagnetism and valence bond solid orders proximate to criticality. Guided by our numerical finding, we develop a field theory description of the direct transition involving an emergent nonabelian [SU(2)] gauge theory and a matrix Higgs field. We contrast our results with the conventional GrossNeveuYukawa transition.},

abstract = {We show that, in contrast to popular belief, sub-wavelength information can be recovered from the far-field of an optical image, thereby overcoming the loss of information embedded in decaying evanescent waves. The only requirement is that the image is known to be sparse, a specific but very general and wide-spread property of signals which occur almost everywhere in nature. The reconstruction method relies on newly-developed compressed sensing techniques, which we adapt to optical super-resolution and sub-wavelength imaging. Our approach exhibits robustness to noise and imperfections. We provide an experimental proof-of-principle by demonstrating image recovery at a spatial resolution 5-times higher than the finest resolution defined by a spatial filter. The technique is general, and can be extended beyond optical microscopy, for example, to atomic force microscopes, scanning-tunneling microscopes, and other imaging systems.},
